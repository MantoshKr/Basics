<h1>MAMMALS</h1>

<p>Mammals include humans and all other animals that are warm-blooded vertebrates
     (vertebrates have backbones) with hair.
    They  have a more well-developed brain than other types of animals.  </p>

    <P>Aardvark

      The aardvark gets its name from a South African word meaning “earth pig.” Although the aardvark looks like a pig, especially with its body and snout, 
      aardvarks actually share common ancestors with elephants and golden moles. Aardvarks live throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa.
    <br>
    STRONG CLAWS

    Aardvarks use their large front claws to dig holes at a rate of 2 feet (0.6 meters) in 15 seconds so they can quickly get to their favorite meal: termites and ants. Aardvarks have long, sticky tongues, which can be up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Each night, they are able to dig up termite mounds and ant nests and slurp up and swallow tens of thousands of insects.
    
    Aardvarks are most active at night and tend to live alone. During the day, they sleep curled up in a ball in their burrows. As night falls, aardvarks will emerge cautiously from their dens, jumping around on the lookout for predators. They are able to see at night, but otherwise have poor vision and are color-blind.
     They rely on their senses of sound and smell, using their long ears and snouts to get around and find insects.
